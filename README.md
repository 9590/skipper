### Streaming Multipart File Upload Parsing 

Skipper is an opinionated variant of Connect's body parser designed to support streaming upload of monolithic files to a compatible blob receiver, while still allowing application code to run in a timely manner; without writing .tmp files to disk.

> This module ~~may~~ **will** be included as a part of the stable release of Sails v0.10.  However we need help with documentation, examples, and writing additional receivers (currently receivers for S3 and local disk exist.)
> The decision to include skipper in v0.10 was tough-- it has stalled our release.  However, it was a consequence of rewriting this module to use streams2, as well as the spotty/fragmented/confusing state of file uploads around the community.  We hope this module helps clear things up for everybody.



### Installation

This module is a drop-in replacement for the Connect bodyParser which is currently used by default in Sails and Express.  Therefore, we need to disable the default and hook up Skipper instead.

#### With Sails (v0.10.0)

As of v0.10.0-rc6, skipper is included as the default request body parser in Sails.


#### With Sails (v0.9.x)

To use skipper with an existing v0.9.x Sails app, you'll need to install skipper:

```sh
npm install skipper --save
```
 
Then modify `config/express.js`:

```javascript
// ...
bodyParser: require('skipper')
// ...
```

#### With Express

In the file where you set up your middleware:

```javascript
// ...
app.use(require('skipper')());
// ...
```


### Usage

`req.file(foo)` returns a stream of binary streams- one for each file that was uploaded to the specified parameter (`foo`) via an HTTP multipart file upload.  As is true with most middleware, the usage is identical between Sails and Express.

#### With Sails

In one of your controller actions:

```javascript
  // ...
  upload: function  (req, res) {
    var SomeReceiver = require('../receivers/someReceiver');
    req.file('avatar').upload( SomeReceiver() , function (err, files) {
      if (err) return res.serverError(err);
      return res.json({
        message: files.length + ' file(s) uploaded successfully!',
        files: files
      });
    });
  }
  // ...
```

#### With Express

```javascript
app.post('/upload', function uploadAction (req, res) {
  var SomeReceiver = require('./receivers/someReceiver');
  req.file('avatar').upload( SomeReceiver() , function (err, files) {
    if (err) return res.send(500, err);
    return res.json({
      message: files.length + ' file(s) uploaded successfully!',
      files: files
    });
  });
});
```

### Status

Currently, this project is in beta, and openly released on npm.  Development takes place on the `master` branch.
