file-parser
===========

Opinionated variant of Connect's multipart body parser designed to support streaming upload of monolithic files to a compatible Waterline adapter, while still allowing application code to run in a timely manner; without writing .tmp files to disk.

Currently under active development.

This module may or may not be included as a part of the stable release of Sails v0.10-- need more documentation, examples, and "receivers" (currently receivers for S3 and local disk exist.)
