	 * UploadStream
	 *
	 * A stream of signal events, where each signal event contains
	 * a paused multipart "fileStream" from Formidable.
	 *
	 * Examples of uploadstreams:
	 * + req.file('foo')
	 * + req.files
	 * + req.file('bar')
	 *
	 * NOTE: UploadStreams are paused upon instantiation!
	 * (resume with `instance.resume()`)
	 * Resumed automatically by any compatible streaming
	 * binary adapter in Sails.
	 *
	 * This can be made more versatile in the future.
	 * Currently, it is using a custom pause/resume implementation
	 * because formidable is not compatible with the latest Node streams
	 * implementation.
	 *
	 * @implements Writable
	 * @implements Resumeable
	 * @extends {Stream}
