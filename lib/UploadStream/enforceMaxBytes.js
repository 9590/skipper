	// This DOES NOT, however, trigger the end of the current field/part stream.
	// But is that even what we want to do?  Yes, and here's why:
	// If a `maxBytes` constraint is validated, the underlying
	// read stream (usually a HTTP request) will be ended.
	// This is so no more bytes will show up for this file upload, which is good.
	// That said, it will stop the stream, meaning that any other instance of UploadStream
	// depending on that fileStream will no longer be able to read from the stream.
	//
	// For example:
	// Let's say we're listening through `req.files` to a file upload sent with the form-data
	// field name "foo".  If the file violates a constraint, it will be rejected not only
	// on `req.files`, but also on `req.file('foo')`

	// This line prevents incoming data events for the fileStream
	// from continuing to write to this, OR ANY, upload stream.
	fileStream.removeAllListeners('data');


	// Now we've prevented more incoming data from hitting us, and we know that this stream
	// is essentially dead.  If this is the universal stream, do nothing.
	// TODO: do something smarter and make the universal stream still work.
	if ( !fileStream.fieldName ) {
		var doSomethingSmarter;
		// log('Universal file upload stream was halted because it exceeded `maxBytes`.');
	}

	// If this is the stream for a specific file listener, subtract the bytes of the
	// stream from the totalBytesWritten that we're tracking.  Since that will be garbage-collected
	// anyway, this allows us to ignore the big file and continue to upload other files, since we may
	// still be able to upload them without exceeding maxBytes.
	else {
		var doSomethingElseSmarter;
		// log('File upload stream for ' + fileStream.fieldName + ' was halted because `maxBytes` was exceeded.');
